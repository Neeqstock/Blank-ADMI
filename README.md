# Blank ADMI

A blank software ADMI based on [NeeqDMIs](https://github.com/Neeqstock/NeeqDMIs) library, following its instrument development philosophy. To be used as a starting point for instrument development.

I made this mainly to help my thesis students, in order to introduce them to instrument making, and to solve some Tobii Interaction library (now deprecated) issues and compatibilities.
